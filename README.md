# react-redux-saga-boilerplate

A lightweight react redux saga boilerplate

## Features

### Quick scaffolding

Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas right from the CLI!

### Absolute Import Path

You can absolute import `import { Button } from 'components/button'`

### Component-centric splitting

Build with `react-loadable` a higher-order component (a function that creates a component) which lets you dynamically load any module before rendering it into your app.
